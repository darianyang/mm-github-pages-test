## Postdocs
A position is available for one postdoctoral researcher to join us in developing new methods that will enable the simulation of pathways and kinetics for biological processes on pharmaceutically relevant timescales (beyond milliseconds). These efforts are funded over the next three years by an NIH RO1 renewal titled “High-performance weighted ensemble software for simulation of complex bio-events”. Applications will involve joint efforts with experimental collaborators to characterize the mechanisms of complex processes such as large-scale protein conformational transitions, allosteric protein binding, and folding-based protein switching. Work may also interface with my lab’s collaborations with OpenEye Scientific to integrate the WESTPA software for weighted ensemble simulations with the Orion Cloud Computing Platform. 

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in scientific software development, methods development, and molecular dynamics simulations. We encourage diversity of all types, and applications from women and minorities are particularly encouraged. 

***This position is expected to start January 2021 or at a later time on mutual agreement***. The initial appointment is for a period of one year and the contract is renewable for another year, pending satisfactory research progress. 

To apply, please email the following to ltchong DOT pitt DOT edu: a CV, a cover letter explaining your interest in the position, and contact information for three references. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. 


## Graduate Students
Positions are available for students with interests in the research area of computational biophysics. To be considered for a position, please apply to one of the following graduate programs at the University of Pittsburgh:
